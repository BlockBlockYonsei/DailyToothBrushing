          Teeth-cleaning twigs have long been used throughout human history.[3]
          As long ago as 3000 B.C., the ancient Egyptians constructed crude
          toothbrushes from twigs and leaves to clean their teeth. Similarly,
          other cultures such as the Greeks, Romans, Arabs and Indians also
          cleaned their teeth with twigs. Some would fray one end of the twig so
          that it could penetrate between the teeth more effectively. In the
          Islamic prophetic tradition, Muhammad taught his disciples to brush
          their teeth using miswak five times per day, and this remains
          prevalent amongst many Muslims world wide since 610 A.D.[4] The Indian
          method of using wood for brushing was presented by the Chinese Monk
          Yijing (635–713 A.D.) when he described the rules for monks in his
          book:[5] Every day in the morning, a monk must chew a piece of tooth
          wood to brush his teeth and scrape his tongue, and this must be done
          in the proper way. Only after one has washed one's hands and mouth may
          one make salutations. Otherwise both the saluter and the saluted are
          at fault. In Sanskrit, the tooth wood is known as the
          dantakastha—danta meaning tooth, and kastha, a piece of wood. It is
          twelve finger-widths in length. The shortest is not less than eight
          finger-widths long, resembling the little finger in size. Chew one end
          of the wood well for a long while and then brush the teeth with it.
          Brushing teeth with chewing stick. Modern-day tooth brushing as a
          regular habit became prevalent in Europe from the end of the 17th
          century. The first mass-produced toothbrush was developed in England
          in 1780 by William Addis. In the United States, although toothbrushes
          were available at the end of the 19th century, the practice did not
          become widespread until after the Second World War, when US soldiers
          continued the tooth brushing that had been required during their
          military service.[6]
